1. I would rate my comfort level as 7.5/10 when it comes to SQL databases. I've worked with them in almost every lab and project done in school. Recently the last major project was a website that stored a lot of movie and tv show data, alongside user data. For this my team and I worked with a PostgreSQL database.
2. My first step is to take a couple minutes just poking around inside the codebase. Taking notes of how things work, reading what comments are there, running the program etc.. I don't know if it is the most efficient method, but it does work great for me to help to build a beginning map of the codebase in my mind. I've done this quite a bit for assessments as generally we are given a repo that we have not worked in before as the base for our work. If the author is available like in some of our code reviews then asking any questions that come to mind is a great way to understand not only how it functions but why certain decisions were made.
